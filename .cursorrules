# MessageAI Project Rules

## Critical Constraints

### Commit Workflow

- Commit during substantial PR implementation work, before user review
- Do NOT commit during user's PR review/approval phase unless they ask me to
<!-- - **Before each commit:** run `npm run validate` (lint + type-check + test)
- If validation fails: fix issues, validate again, then commit fixes
- **After commit:** Do NOT run validate again (linter may auto-fix imports, creating extra commits)
- If linter auto-fixed files after commit, amend the commit you just made to include the lint fixes -->

### Testing Workflow

<!-- - **Before asking user to test:** ALWAYS run `npm run validate` with `required_permissions: ['all']`
- Must pass with 0 errors and 0 warnings before user testing -->
- Fix ALL linting errors and warnings before presenting code for testing
- Use `--fix` option where applicable to auto-fix style issues

<!-- ### Progress Tracking

- After completing a phase (or significant tasks within a phase), update and check off items in `/docs/PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`
- Mark tasks as complete with checkboxes: `- [x] Task completed`
- Progress tracker updates should be committed AFTER code commits (separate commit)
- This helps track overall project progress and ensures nothing is missed -->

### Deployment

- Always prefix deploy commands with `time` to measure deployment duration

### Git History

- NEVER rewrite git history (no force push, no rebase on shared branches, no --amend on pushed commits)
- Use `git revert` instead of rewriting history to undo changes

### App Restarts

After making code changes, inform the user if they need to restart the app, and if they need to do anything else (for example a clean npm install).

<!-- **Restart REQUIRED for:**

- Changes to 

**Hot reload SUFFICIENT for:**

- Changes to 

**Tell the user:** "✅ Hot reload should work fine" OR "⚠️ You'll need to restart the dev server (Ctrl+C, then `npx expo start`)" -->

### Document Generation

- Check in before creating a markdown document — explain the purpose to me first
- Create new documents in the `/docs/` folder - not in root
- After you create a document, but before you commit, immediately review it and look for how to make it more concise without losing information
- NEVER directly update `/docs/memory.md` — instead, suggest changes in chat

### Accuracy

- **NEVER** claim "this is how WhatsApp does it" or "this is the approach [app] takes" unless you have verified information
- Don't make up implementation details about how other apps work

### Version Control

- All dependency versions are **PINNED**
- Do NOT upgrade dependencies without explicit approval
- Check package.json before installing new packages

<!-- ## Architecture Guidelines

### Navigation

- Use **thing**

### State Management

- Zustand for  -->
