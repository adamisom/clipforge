# ✅ Phases A-C Implementation Complete!

## What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Phase A: Multi-Track Timeline Foundation
**Status:** Complete & Ready for Testing

**Features:**
- Two-track vertical timeline (Track 0: Main, Track 1: PiP)
- Visual distinction (blue gradient for main, purple for PiP)
- Track labels ("Main" / "PiP")
- Right-click context menu to move clips between tracks
- Playhead spans both tracks
- Only Track 0 plays in preview (Track 1 is overlay metadata for export)
- Auto-assignment: webcam → Track 1, screen/imported → Track 0

**Testing:**
1. Import video → appears on Track 0
2. Record webcam → appears on Track 1  
3. Record screen → appears on Track 0
4. Right-click any clip → Move to Track 0 / Track 1
5. Playhead should play Track 0 clips only

---

### ✅ Phase B: Simultaneous Screen + Webcam Recording
**Status:** Complete & Ready for Testing

**Features:**
- New "Record Screen + Webcam" menu item (Cmd+Shift+B)
- Source selection with live webcam preview
- 3-2-1 countdown with Esc to cancel
- Synchronized recording start (same event loop tick)
- Dual MediaRecorder management
- Both recordings automatically added to correct tracks:
  - Screen → Track 0
  - Webcam → Track 1
- Same duration applied from shared recording timer
- Global shortcut (Cmd+Shift+S) to stop

**Testing:**
1. File → Record Screen + Webcam (or Cmd+Shift+B)
2. Select screen source
3. Verify webcam preview appears
4. Click "Start Recording"
5. Wait for countdown
6. Record something
7. Press Cmd+Shift+S to stop
8. Verify two clips appear:
   - Screen clip on Track 0 (blue)
   - Webcam clip on Track 1 (purple)
9. Verify durations match

### ✅ Phase C: PiP Configuration + Preview
**Status:** Partial (Preview Complete, Export Pending)

**Completed Features:**
- PiP configuration UI in InfoPanel:
  - Position dropdown (4 corners)
  - Size dropdown (Small 15% / Medium 25% / Large 40%)
- Live PiP preview in VideoPreview:
  - Dual video rendering (main + overlay)
  - Synchronized playback/seeking
  - PiP video muted in preview
  - Dynamic positioning and sizing
  - White border + drop shadow styling
- Current PiP clip calculated at playhead position
- Track indicator in InfoPanel ("Main" vs "PiP")

**Pending:**
- **C.4: Multi-Track Export with FFmpeg Overlay**  
  Currently, export only exports Track 0. Need to implement FFmpeg overlay filter when Track 1 clips exist.

**Testing (Preview Only):**
1. After simultaneous recording (or manual track assignment):
2. Verify PiP clip appears as overlay in preview
3. Change PiP position (4 corners) → updates immediately
4. Change PiP size (small/medium/large) → updates immediately
5. Drag playhead → PiP syncs correctly
6. Play video → PiP plays in sync
7. ⚠️ **Do NOT test export yet** - multi-track export not implemented

## What's NOT Implemented Yet

### 🚧 Phase C.4: Multi-Track Export with FFmpeg Overlay
**Status:** Not Started

**Scope:**
- Detect if Track 1 clips exist
- For each Track 0 clip, find overlapping Track 1 clips
- Generate FFmpeg overlay filter with:
  - Position mapping (PiPConfig → FFmpeg overlay coordinates)
  - Size calculation
  - Duration matching
- Concatenate multi-track clips
- Track duration mismatch warning (if Track 0/1 durations differ)

**Estimated Effort:** ~3-4 hours

---

### 🚧 Phase D: Audio Mixing Controls
**Status:** Not Started

**Scope:**
- Track volume sliders in InfoPanel (Track 0, Track 1)
- Store volume state (0.0-1.0)
- Pass to FFmpeg export (amix filter)
- Only show Track 1 slider if Track 1 has clips

**Estimated Effort:** ~2 hours

---

### 🚧 Phase E: Timeline Zoom
**Status:** Not Started

**Scope:**
- Zoom buttons (+ / - / Reset) or slider
- Zoom state (zoom level multiplier)
- Update `pixelsPerSecond` dynamically
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+= / Cmd+- / Cmd+0)
- Zoom centered on playhead

**Estimated Effort:** ~2-3 hours

---

### 🚧 Phase F: Integration & Testing
**Status:** Not Started

**Scope:**
- Comprehensive manual testing of all Phase 3 features
- Edge case testing (track mismatches, no PiP clips, etc.)
- Bug fixes from testing
- Documentation updates (ARCHITECTURE.md, MANUAL_TESTING_GUIDE.md)

**Estimated Effort:** ~3-4 hours

---

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

**Option 1: Test A-C Now (Recommended)**
- Test multi-track timeline
- Test simultaneous recording
- Test PiP preview (but skip export)
- Provide feedback
- Then implement C.4 + D-F

**Option 2: Continue Implementation**
- Implement C.4 (multi-track export)
- Implement D (audio mixing)
- Implement E (zoom)
- Then test everything (Phase F)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Limitations

1. **PiP Preview Sync Drift**: Long previews may experience slight A/V sync drift between main and PiP. This is preview-only and does not affect exports.
2. **PiP Audio Not Mixed in Preview**: PiP audio is muted in preview. Audio mixing only happens during export.
3. **Export Only Exports Track 0**: Multi-track export not yet implemented. Only main video exports currently.
